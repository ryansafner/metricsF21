# Calculating $R^2$ in R I

- Recall `broom`'s `augment()` command makes a lot of new regression-based values like:
    - `.fitted`: predicted values $(\hat{Y_i})$
    - `.resid`: residuals $(\hat{u_i})$
    
```{r, echo=T}
library(broom)
school_reg %>%
  augment() %>%
  head(., n=5) # show first 5 values
```

---

# Calculating $R^2$ in R II

- Or, simpler, can calculate $R^2$ in `R` as the ratio of variances in model vs. actual 

.code60[
```{r, echo = T}
# as ratio of variances
school_reg %>%
  augment() %>%
  summarize(r_sq = var(.fitted)/var(testscr)) # var. of *predicted* testscr over var. of *actual* testscr
```
]

$$R^2 = \frac{var(\hat{Y})}{var(Y)} = \frac{\color{red}{\frac{1}{n-1}}\sum^n_{i=1}(\hat{Y_i}-\bar{Y})^2}{\color{red}{\frac{1}{n-1}}\sum^n_{i=1}(Y_i-\bar{Y})^2} \rightarrow \frac{ESS}{TSS}$$

- ESS and TSS are simply the numerators of the variance of $\hat{Y}$ and $Y$, respectively (i.e. before dividing by $n-1$, which will cancel out).

---

# Goodness of Fit: Standard Error of the Regression

- .hi[Standard Error of the Regression], $\hat{\sigma}$ or $\hat{\sigma}_{u}$ is an estimator of the standard deviation of $u_i$

--

$$\hat{\sigma_u}=\sqrt{\frac{SSE}{n-2}}$$

--

- Measures the .hi-purple[average size of the residuals] (distances between data points and the regression line)
  - An average prediction error of the line
  - .hi-turquoise[Degrees of Freedom correction] of $n-2$: we use up 2 df to first calculate $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$!

- We use econometrics to .hi-purple[identify] causal relationships and make .hi-purple[inferences] about them

1. Problem for .hi-purple[identification]: .hi[endogeneity]
    - $X$ is **exogenous** if its variation is *unrelated* to other factors $(u)$ that affect $Y$
    - $X$ is **endogenous** if its variation is *related* to other factors $(u)$ that affect $Y$

2. Problem for .hi-purple[inference]: .hi[randomness]
    - Data is random due to **natural sampling variation**
    - Taking one sample of a population will yield slightly different information than another sample of the same population

# Distributions of the OLS Estimators

- OLS estimators $(\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1})$ are computed from a finite (specific) sample of data

- Our OLS model contains **2 sources of randomness**:

--

- .hi-purple[*Modeled* randomness]: $u$ includes all factors affecting $Y$ *other* than $X$
    - different samples will have different values of those other factors $(u_i)$

--

- .hi-purple[*Sampling* randomness]: different samples will generate different OLS estimators
    - Thus, $\hat{\beta_0}, \hat{\beta_1}$ are *also* **random variables**, with their own <span class=hi>sampling distribution</span>

# I.I.D. Samples

.pull-left[

- If we collect many samples, and each sample is randomly drawn from the population (and then replaced), then the distribution of samples is said to be .hi-purple[independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.)]

- Each sample is **independent** of each other sample (due to replacement)

# The Sampling Distribution of OLS Estimators

.pull-left[
- Calculating OLS estimators for a sample makes the OLS estimators *themselves* random variables:

- Draw of $i$ is random $\implies$ value of each $(X_i,Y_i)$ is random $\implies$ $\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}$ are random

- Taking different samples will create different values of $\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}$

- Therefore, $\hat{\beta_0},\hat{\beta_1}$ each have a .hi[sampling distribution] across different samples

# The Central Limit Theorem

- .hi[Central Limit Theorem (CLT)]: if we collect samples of size $n$ from the same population and generate a sample statistic (e.g. OLS estimator), then with large enough $n$, the distribution of the sample statistic is approximately normal IF 
    1. $n \geq 30$
    2. Samples come from a *known* normal distribution $\sim N(\mu,\sigma)$

--

- If neither of these are true, we have other methods (coming shortly!) 

- One of the most fundamental principles in all of statistics

- Allows for virtually all testing of statistical hypotheses $\rightarrow$ estimating probabilities of values on a normal distribution

---

# The Sampling Distribution of $\hat{\beta_1}$ I

.pull-left[

- The CLT allows us to approximate the sampling distributions of $\hat{\beta_0}$ and $\hat{\beta_1}$ as normal

- We care about $\hat{\beta_1}$ (slope) since it has economic meaning, rarely about $\hat{\beta_0}$ (intercept)

$$\hat{\beta_1} \sim N(E[\hat{\beta_1}], \sigma_{\hat{\beta_1}})$$

.green[**Example**]:
We want to estimate the average height (H) of U.S. adults (population) and have a random sample of 100 adults.]

--

- Calculate the mean height of our sample $(\bar{H})$ to estimate the true mean height of the population $(\mu_H)$

- $\bar{H}$ is an **estimator** of $\mu_H$

--

- There are many estimators we *could* use to estimate $\mu_H$
  - How about using the first value in our sample: $H_1$ ?

- What makes one estimator (e.g. $\bar{H}$) better than another (e.g. $H_1$)?<sup>.magenta[†]</sup>

1. .hi-purple[Biasedness]: does the estimator give us the true parameter *on average*?  

2. .hi-purple[Efficiency]: an estimator with a smaller variance is better

- $\mathbf{\hat{\beta_1}}$ is the .hi[Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE)] estimator of  $\mathbf{\beta_1}$ **when $X$ is exogenous**<sup>.magenta[†]</sup>

- No systematic difference, on average, between sample values of $\hat{\beta_1}$ and the true population $\beta_1$:

$$E[\hat{\beta_1}]=\beta_1$$

- Does *not* mean that each sample gives us $\hat{\beta_1}=\beta_1$, only the estimation **procedure** will, **on average**, yield the correct value

# Exogeneity and Unbiasedness II

- Recall, an .hi[exogenous] variable $(X)$ is unrelated to other factors affecting $Y$, i.e.:

$$cor(X,u)=0$$

--

- Again, this is called the **Zero Conditional Mean Assumption**

$$E(u|X)=0$$

--

- For any known value of $X$, the expected value of $u$ is 0

- Knowing the value of $X$ must tell us *nothing* about the value of $u$ (anything else relevant to $Y$ other than $X$)

- We can then confidently assert causation: $X \rightarrow Y$

---

# Endogeneity and Bias

- Nearly all independent variables are .hi[endogenous], they **are** related to the error term $u$
$$cor(X,u)\neq 0$$

--

.bg-washed-green.b--dark-green.ba.bw2.br3.shadow-5.ph4.mt5[
.green[**Example**]: Suppose we estimate the following relationship:

$$\text{Violent crimes}_t=\beta_0+\beta_1\text{Ice cream sales}_t+u_t$$

- We find $\hat{\beta_1}>0$

- Does this mean Ice cream sales $\rightarrow$ Violent crimes?

# Endogeneity and Bias: Takeaways

.smaller[
- The true expected value of $\hat{\beta_1}$ is actually:<sup>.magenta[†]</sup>

$$E[\hat{\beta_1}]=\beta_1+cor(X,u)\frac{\sigma_u}{\sigma_X}$$

]
--

.smallest[
1) If $X$ is exogenous: $cor(X,u)=0$, we're just left with $\beta_1$
]

--

.smallest[
2) The larger $cor(X,u)$ is, larger .hi-purple[bias]: $\left(E[\hat{\beta_1}]-\beta_1 \right)$
]

--

.smallest[
3) We can .hi-purple[“sign”] the direction of the bias based on $cor(X,u)$
  - .hi-purple[Positive] $cor(X,u)$ overestimates the true $\beta_1$ $(\hat{\beta_1}$ is too high)
  - .hi-purple[Negative] $cor(X,u)$ underestimates the true $\beta_1$ $(\hat{\beta_1}$ is too low)
