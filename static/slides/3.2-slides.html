- We will also explore the different common .hi[research designs] meant to .hi-purple[identify] causal relationships

- Greater ice cream sales `\(\rightarrow\)` more violent crime

# Counterfactuals

.pull-left[

- The *sine qua non* of causal claims are .hi[counterfactuals]: what would `\(Y\)` have been if `\(X\)` had been different?

- Need a (theoretical) .hi-purpl[causal model] of the data-generating process!

# Counterfactuals and RCTs

.pull-left[
.quitesmall[
- Again, RCTs are invoked as the gold standard for their ability to make counterfactual claims:

- Treatment/intervention `\((X)\)` is **randomly assigned** to individuals

&gt; If person i who recieved treatment *had not recieved* the treatment, we can predict what his outcome *would have been*

&gt; If person j who did not recieve treatment *had recieved treatment*, we can predict what her outcome *would have been*

- We can say this because, on average, treatment and control groups are *the same before treatment*

# Causal Diagrams/DAGs

1. Consider all the variables likely to be important to the data-generating process (including variables we can't observe!)

2. For simplicity, combine some similar ones together or prune those that aren't very important

3. Consider which variables are likely to affect others, and draw arrows connecting them

4. Test some testable implications of the model (to see if we have a correct one!)

# Side Notes

.pull-left[
.smallest[
- Drawing an arrow requires a direction - making a statement about causality!

- *Omitting* an arrow makes an equally important statement too!
  - In fact, we will *need* omitted arrows to show causality!

- If two variables are correlated, but neither causes the other, likely they are both caused by another (perhaps **unobserved**) variable - add it!

- There should be no *cycles* or *loops* (if so, there’s probably another missing variable, such as time)

- Makes our assumptions **explicit**, and many of them are **testable**

- DAG suggests certain relationships that will *not* exist:
  - all relationships between `laws` and `conx` go through `educ`
  - so if we controlled for `educ`, then `cor(laws,conx)` should be zero!
