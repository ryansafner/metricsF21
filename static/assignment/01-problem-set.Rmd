# The Popularity of Baby Names

Install and load the package `babynames`. Get help for `?babynames` to see what the data includes.

```{r}
# write your code here! 
```

## 1. 
### a. 
**What are the top 5 boys names for 2017, and what *percent* of overall names is each?**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 1-a}
# write your code here! 
```


### b.
**What are the top 5 *girls* names for 2017, and what *percent* of overall names is each?**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 1-b}
# write your code here! 
```

## 2. 
**Make two barplots of these top 5 names, one for each sex. Map `aes`thetics `x` to `name` and `y` to `prop` [or `percent`, if you made that variable, as I did.] and use `geom_col` (since you are declaring a specific `y`, otherwise you could just use `geom_bar()` and just an `x`.)**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 2}
# write your code here! 
```


## 3. 
**Find your name. [If your name isn't in there :(, pick a random name.] `count` by `sex` how many babies since 1880 were named your name. [Hint: if you do this, you'll get the number of *rows* (years) there are in the data. You want to add the number of babies in each row (`n`), so inside `count`, add `wt = n` to weight the count by `n`.] Also add a variable for the percent of each sex.**


<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 3}
# write your code here! 
```

## 4.
**Make a line graph of the number of babies with your name over time, `color`ed by `sex`.**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 4}
# write your code here! 
```


## 5.
### a.
**Find the most common name for boys by year between 1980-2017. [Hint: you'll want to first `group_by(year)`. Once you've got all the right conditions, you'll get a table with a lot of data. You only want to `slice(1)` to keep just the 1st row of each year's data.]**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 5-a}
# write your code here! 
```

### b.
**Now do the same for girls.**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 5-b}
# write your code here! 
```

## 6. Now let's graph the evolution of the most common names since 1880.
### a.
**First, find out what are the top 10 *overall* most popular names for boys and for girls in the data. [Hint: first `group_by(name)`.] You may want to create two objects, each with these top 5 names as character elements.**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 6-a}
# write your code here! 
```

### b.
**Now make two `line`graphs of these 5 names over time, one for boys, and one for girls. [Hint: you'll first want to subset the data to use for your `data` layer in the plot. First `group_by(year)` and also make sure you only use the names you found in Part A. Try using the `%in%` command to do this.]**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 6-b}
# write your code here! 
```

## 7.
**_Bonus (hard!): What are the 10 most common "gender-neutral" names? [This is hard to define. For our purposes, let's define this as names where between 48% and 52% of the babies with the name are Male.]**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 7}
# write your code here!

# Political and Economic Freedom Around the World

**For the remaining questions, we'll look at the relationship between Economic Freedom and Political Freedom in countries around the world today. Our data for economic freedom comes from the [Fraser Institute](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/economic-freedom/dataset?geozone=world&year=2016&page=dataset), and our data for political freedom comes from [Freedom House](https://freedomhouse.org/content/freedom-world-data-and-resources).**

## 8. 
Download these two datasets that I've cleaned up a bit: [If you want a challenge, try downloading them from the websites and cleaning them up yourself!]

- [<i class="fas fa-table"></i> `econ_freedom.csv`](http://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/data/econ_freedom.csv)
- [<i class="fas fa-table"></i> `pol_freedom.csv`](http://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/data/pol_freedom.csv)

Below is a brief description of the variables I've put in each dataset:

### Econ Freedom

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `year` | Year |
| `ISO` | Three-letter country code |
| `country` | Name of the country |
| `ef_index` | Total economic freedom index (0 - least to 100 - most) |
| `rank` | Rank of the country in terms of economic freedom |
| `continent` | Continent the country is in |

### Pol Freedom

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `country` | Name of the country |
| `C/T` | Whether the location is a country (C) or territory (T) |
| `year` | Year |
| `status` | Whether the location is Free (F), Partly Free (F) or Not Free (NF) |
| `fh_score` | Total political freedom index (0 - least to 100 - most) |

Import and save them each as an object using `my_df_name <- read_csv("name_of_the_file.csv")`. I suggest one as `econ` and the other as `pol`, but it's up to you. Look at each object you've created.

```{r 8}
# write your code here! 
```

## 9. 
**Now let's join them together so that we can have a single dataset to work with. You can learn more about this [in the 1.4 slides](https://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/slides/1.4-slides#143). Since both datasets have both `country` and `year` (spelled exactly the same in both!), we can use these two variables as a `key` to combine observations. Run the following code (substituting whatever you want to name your objects):**

```{r, echo = T, eval = F}
freedom <- left_join(econ, pol, by=c("country", "year"))
```

**Take a look at `freedom` to make sure it appears to have worked.**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 9}
# write your code here! 
```

## 10.
### a.
**Make a barplot of the 10 countries with the highest Economic Freedom index score in 2018. You may want to find this first and save it as an object for your plot's `data` layer. Use `geom_col()` since we will map `ef_index` to `y`. If you want to order the bars, set `x = fct_reorder(ISO, desc(ef_index))` to reorder `ISO` (or `country`, if you prefer) by EF score in descending order.**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 10-a}
# write your code here! 
```

### b.
**Make a barplot of the 10 countries with the highest Freedom House index score in 2018, similar to what you did for Part A.**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 10-b}
# write your code here! 
```

## 11.
**Now make a scatterplot of Political freedom (`fh_score` as `y`) on Economic Freedom (`ef_index` as `x`) and `color` by `continent`.**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 11}
# write your code here! 
```

## 12.
**Save your plot from Question 11 as an object, and add a new layer where we will highlight a few countries. Pick a few countries (I suggest using the `ISO` code) and create a new object `filtering` the data to only include these countries (again the `%in%` command will be most helpful here).**

**Additionally, **install** and **load** a package called `"ggrepel"`, which will adjust labels so they do not overlap on a plot.**

**Then, add the following layer to your plot:**

```{r, eval = F}
geom_label_repel(data = countries, # or whatever object name you created
                     aes(x = ef_index,
                         y = fh_score,
                         label = ISO, # show ISO as label (you could do country instead)
                         color = continent),
                     alpha = 0.5, # make it a bit transparent
                     box.padding = 0.75, # control how far labels are from points
                     show.legend = F) # don't want this to add to the legend
```

**This should highlight these countries on your plot.**

<!--WRITE YOUR ANSWERS BELOW -->

```{r 12}
# write your code here! 
```

## 13.
**Let's just look only at the United States and see how it has fared in both measures of freedom over time. `filter()` the data to look only at `ISO == "USA"`. Use both a `geom_point()` layer and a `geom_path()` layer, which will connect the dots over time. Let's also see this by labeling the years with an additional layer `geom_text_repel(aes(label = year))`.**
