On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand. This forces you to selectively filter my lecture to its most essential and important components \u0026ndash; an integral part of the learning and retention process. If you are taking notes on a laptop, you become a court stenographer, thoughtlessly transcribing everything I am saying. At the other extreme, do not assume everything is written in my lecture slides. My lecture slides are visuals and cues to organize the content both for me and for you. I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.  My suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.   At least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can\u0026rsquo;t rely on heuristics or memory to \u0026ldquo;fill in the blanks.\u0026rdquo; You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it\u0026rsquo;s discovered you haven\u0026rsquo;t done the reading. Do the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you \u0026ldquo;get inside my head\u0026rdquo; and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade. Work on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don\u0026rsquo;t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.^[Yes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!] As a wise woman once told me \u0026ldquo;whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.\u0026rdquo; Learn how to learn. The most important skill you learn in college is how to learn. Taking a course on a subject will not make you an expert on that subject. It a) helps you recognize that you do not know everything on that subject, and this prevents you from actively saying stupid things; and b) gives you enough context and skills to figure out how to actually fill those gaps. This is the actual skill that\u0026rsquo;s relevant in the real world.^[Yes, Google is your best friend. But you do not yet know how to ask the right questions, or understand what constitutes good answers.]  ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626808675,"objectID":"a8f2b974e9ce460bb770962ed237d1c6","permalink":"https://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/tips/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/resources/tips/","section":"resources","summary":"Take notes.

The World Bank keeps track of many country-level indicators over time. tidycensus gives you access to data from the US Census and the American Community Survey. These are the largest high-quality data sets you’ll find of cross-sectional data on individual people in the US. You’ll need to get a (free) API key from the website (or ask me for mine). fredr gets data from the Federal Reserve’s Economic Database (FRED). You’ll need to get a (free) API key from the website (or ask me for mine). tidyquant gets data from a number of financial sources (including fredr). icpsrdata downloads data from the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (you’ll need an account and a keycode). ICPSR is a database of datasets from published social science papers for the purposes of reproducibility. NHANES uses data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. ipumsr has census data from all around the world, in addition to the US census, American Community Survey, and Current Population Survey. If you’re doing international micro work, look at IPUMS. It’s also the easiest way to get the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is very popular for labor economics. Unfortunately ipumsr won’t get the data from within R; you’ll have to make your own data extract on the IPUMS website and download it. But ipumsr will read that file into R and preserve things like names and labels. education-data-package-r4 is the Urban Institute’s data data on educational institutions in the US, including colleges (in IPEDS) and K-12 schools (in CCD). This package also has data on county-level poverty rates from SAIPE. psidR is the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. This study doesn’t just follow people over their lifetimes, it follows their children too, generationally! A great source for studying how things follow families through generations. atus is th e American Time Use Survey, which is a large cross-sectional data set with information on how people spend their time. Rilostat uses data from the International Labor Organization. This contains lots of different statistics on labor, like employment, wage gaps, etc., generally aggregated to the national level and changing over time. democracyData5 is a great “package for accessing and manipulating existing measures of democracy.” politicaldata provides useful functions for obtaining commonly-used data in political analysis and political science, including from sources such as the Comparative Agendas Project (which provides data on politics and policy from 20+ countries), the MIT Election and Data Science Lab, and FiveThirtyEight.

Please try to frame your photos properly! Put your paper flat on a solid surface (table, desk, the floor, etc). Get the whole page within the borders of the photo, and not too much background. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to see half of your desk or bed as you are taking the photo! Take a look at it and make sure it is legible.\nNext, get the photos onto your computer (whether by Airdrop, email to yourself, Dropbox, etc.). Finally, depending on your OS, convert the files to a PDF:\n1. On a Windows PC\nOpen the folder where your photos are currently, in the File Explorer. Select all of the photos, and right click, and select Print. In the dialog box that pops up, select Microsoft Print to PDF in the Printer box, and then click Print. This will save it as a .pdf file in that folder. See more information.\n2. On a Mac\nAs I use a Mac, I will show you how Mac OS has a neat feature built into Finder, which allows converting multiple files into a single PDF file as a Quick Action.

It uses real data to test economic hypotheses, quantitatively estimate causal relationships between economic variables, and to make forecasts of future events. The primary tool that economists use for empirical analysis is ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, so the majority of this course will focus on understanding, applying, and extending OLS regressions.\nI assume you have some working knowledge of economics at the intermediate level and some basic statistical tools.The formal prerequisites for this course are ECON 205 and ECON 206; ECMG 212 or MATH 112; and ECON 305 or ECON 306. We will do some basic review of some necessary statistics and probability at the beginning until everyone is comfortable, before jumping right into regressions.\nCourse Format and Covid As of Fall 2021, all students are expected to be on campus except those with special approved exemptions. As such, this course will be taught in-person and synchronously until or unless otherwise announced.\n Course objectives By the end of this course, you will:\nunderstand how to evaluate statistical and empirical claims; use the fundamental models of causal inference and research design; gather, analyze, and communicate with real data in R.  I am less concerned with forcing you to memorize and recite proofs of statistical estimator properties, and more concerned with the development of your intuitions and the ability to think critically as an empirical social scientist—although this will require you to demonstrate proficiency with some intermediate statistical and mathematical tools.\nGiven these objectives, this course fulfills all three of the learning outcomes for the George B. Delaplaine, Jr. School of Business Economics B.A. program:\n Use quantitative tools and techniques in the preparation, interpretation, analysis and presentation of data and information for problem solving and decision making […] Apply economic reasoning and models to understand and analyze problems of public policy […] Demonstrate effective oral and written communications skills for personal and professional success[…]  Fair warning: Econometrics is hard. It will be one of the hardest economics courses that you will take, primarily due to the mathematical content. I will do my best to make this class intuitive and helpful, if not interesting. If at any point you find yourself struggling in this course for any reason, please come see me. Do not suffer in silence! Coming to see me for help does not diminish my view of you, in fact I will hold you in higher regard for understanding your own needs and taking charge of your own learning. There are also a some fantastic resources on campus, such as the Center for Academic Achievement and Retention (CAAR) and the Beneficial-Hodson Library.\nSee my tips for success in this course.\n Required Course materials This course requires regular online internet access. If you know you will be unable to access the internet regularly, please let me know and we can make arrangements.\nYou can find all course materials at my dedicated website for this course: metricsF21.classes.ryansafner.com. Links to the website are posted on our Blackboard course page. Please familiarize yourself with the website, see that it contains this syllabus, resources to help you, and our schedule. On the schedule page, you can find each module with its own class page (start there!) along with all related readings, lecture slides, practice problems, and assignments.\nMy lecture slides will be shared with you, and serve as your primary resource, but our main “textbook” below is recommended as the next best resource and will be available from the campus bookstore. I will discuss more about textbooks and materials in the first module.\nBooks The following book is required and will be available from the campus bookstore. (You are not obligated to buy it, I just strongly recommend it in the sense that you will still have access to all data and assignments without possessing the book. But this is a course where you really will want to understand the derivations or get additional context beyond just my slides…)\n Bailey, Michael A, 2019, Real Econometrics, New York: Oxford University Press, 2nd ed.  You are welcome to purchase the book by other means (e.g. Amazon, half.com, etc). I have no financial stake in requiring you to purchase this book. The (cheaper) 1st edition is sufficient, but makes significantly less use of R (in favor of STATA).\nThe following two books are recommended, and are free online. (You can purchase a hard copy of the first one if you really want.):\n Grolemund, Garrett and Hadley Wickham, R For Data Science Ismay, Chester and Albert Y Kim, Modern Dive: Statistical Inference Via Data Science  The first book is the number one resource for using R and tidyverse, and is written for beginners. I still look at it frequently. The second is another great reference for using tidyverse in the context of basic statistics.\n Articles Throughout the course, I will post both required and supplemental (non-required) readings that enrich your understanding for each topic.\n Software You are strongly recommended to download copies of R and R Studio on your own computers. These software packages are available on all computers in the trading room, and you will have access to them during the week to work on assignments.\nWe will also have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that runs a full instance of R Studio in your web browser (so no need to install anything!) will let you access files and assignments.\n  Assignments and Grades Your final course grade is the weighted average of the following assignments. You can find general descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page and more specific information (such as due dates) and examples on each assignment’s page on the schedule page.\n   Frequency  Assignment  Weight      1  Research Project  30%    n  Problem sets (Average)  25%    1  Midterm  20%    1  Final  25%     Each assignment is graded on a 100 point scale. Letter-grade equivalents are based on the following scale:\n  Grade  Range  Grade  Range      A  93–100%  C  73–76%    A−  90–92%  C−  70–72%    B+  87–89%  D+  67–69%    B  83–86%  D  63–66%    B−  80–82%  D−  60–62%    C+  77–79%  F  \u0026lt; 60%     See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\nThese grades are firm cutoffs, but I do of course round upwards \\((\\geq\\) 0.5) for final grades. A necessary reminder, as an academic, I am not in the business of giving out grades, I merely report the grade that you earn. I will not alter your grade unless you provide a reasonable argument that I am in error (which does happen from time to time).\nSave As - PDF, or File - Export - PDF.] to **upload on Blackboard** under Assignments. You may handwrite answers if you will be able to scan/photograph \u0026 convert them **to a single PDF**, if they are easily readable, but this is *not preferred*. See my [guide to making a PDF](https://gameF21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/#how-to-make-a-pdf-for-submitting-assignments) - an essential skill in the modern world. If you are handwriting answers, you may print the `pdf` above and write on it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers). For the few questions that ask you to draw a **graph**, *try* to do so *on your computer* (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps, etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document. Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to technologically include a graph. Your TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, and one question will be graded for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately. ## Exams There will be three exams (one at the end of each unit) including the final exam. Each exam only covers the material in its associated unit (i.e. no exam is cumulative). These exams provide feedback both to you and to me that ensures everyone is progressing on schedule and apprehending the material. This is critical, as the rest of the course, and indeed, any future economics course you take, will build off of this foundation. Exams will be released **on Blackboard** as a timed assignment. You will have 2 hours once you open the exam on Blackboard. You will not need the whole time, I have given you some extra to accommodate the difficulties of taking an exam at home. Please pick a time to take it where you know you will have 2 hours. You may close the exam page and come back to it, but the timer will continue to run once the exam is first opened. ## Opinion-Editorial Economic fallacies have always been popular, and journalists, politicians, and talking heads consistently engage in faulty economic reasoning in print and on television. Your task, as a student of economics, is to find some issue discussed in the past year, and write a critique of media discussion of that issue. Alternatively, instead of critiquing the reasoning or statements of others, you may write an advocacy piece, where you propose some economic policy and argue to persuade readers to endorse it. You will be graded both on the soundness of your economic reasoning and the quality of your writing. I would be happy to co-author an Op-Ed with anyone who writes an exemplary Op-Ed. Students who successfully publish their work in a media outlet will earn *extra credit* on their Op-Ed grade. I will provide ample resources and examples to help you accomplish this, you can find more on the associated [assignment page](assignment/op-ed). -- No extra credit is available\n Policies and Expectations This syllabus is a contract between you, the student, and me, your instructor. It has been carefully and deliberately thought out. (A syllabus can and will be used as a legal document for disputes tried at a court of law. Ask me how I know.), and I will uphold my end of the agreement and expect you to uphold yours.\nIn the language of game theory, this syllabus is my commitment device. I am a very understanding person, and I know that exceptions to rules often need to be made for students. However, to be fair to all students the syllabus artificially constrains my ability to make exceptions at a whim for anyone. This prevents clever students from exploiting my congenial personality at everyone else’s expense. Please read and familiarize yourself with the course policies and expectations of you. Chances are, if you have a question, it is answered herein.\nLate Assignments I will accept late assignments, but will subtract a specified amount of points as a penalty. Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 15 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 85).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nTerm Papers: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your paper is late.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment.\n Grading I will try my best to post grades on Blackboard’s Grading Center and return graded assignments to you within about one week of you turning them in. There will be exceptions. Where applicable, I will post answer keys once I know most homeworks are turned in (see Late Assignments above for penalties). Blackboard’s Grading Center is the place to look for your most up-to-date grades. See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\n Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Students must regularly monitor their Hood email accounts to receive important college information, including messages related to this class. Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!. My Hood email (safner@hood.edu) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and feel free to send a follow up email in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\nOur slack channel is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their hood emails and true first and last names. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban.\nI will host general “office hours” on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have specific questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:\n  Netiquette When using Zoom and Slack, please follow appropriate internet etiquette (“Netiquette”). Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X?’” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”).\n Privacy Maryland law requires all parties consent for a conversation or meeting to be recorded. If you join in, and certainly if you participate, you are consenting to be recorded. However, as described below, videos are not accessible beyond our class.\nLive lectures are recorded on Zoom and posted to Blackboard via Panopto, a secure course management system for video. Among other nice features (such as multiple video screens, close captioning, and time-stamped search functions!), Panopto is authenticated via your Blackboard credentials, ensuring that our course videos are not accessible to the open internet.\nFor the privacy of your peers, and to foster an environment of trust and academic freedom to explore ideas, do not record our course lectures or discussions. You are already getting my official copies.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevents me from disclosing or discussing any student information, including grades and records about student performance. If the student is at least 18 years of age, parents (or spouses) do not have a right to obtain this information, except with consent by the student.\nMany of you may be tuning in remotely, living with parents, and may have occasional interruptions due to sharing a space. This is normal and fine, but know that I will protect your privacy and not discuss your performance when parents (or anyone other than you, for that matter) are present, without your explicit consent.\n Enrollment Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. The last day to add or drop this class with no penalty is Wednesday, February 10. Be aware of important dates.\n Honor Code Hood College has an Academic Honor Code which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See here for more detailed information.\n Van Halen and M\u0026amp;Ms When you have completed reading the syllabus, email me a picture of the band Van Halen and a picture of a bowl of M\u0026amp;Ms. If you do this before the date of the first exam, you will get bonus points on the exam. If 75-100% of the class does this, you each get 2 points. If 50-75% of the class does this, you each get 4 points. If 25-50% of the class does this, you each get 6 points. If 0-25% of the class does this, you each get 8 points. Yes, you read this correctly.\n Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations College courses can, and should, be challenging and bring you out of your comfort zone in a safe and equitable environment. If, however, you feel at any point in the semester that certain assignments or aspects of the course will be disproportionately uncomfortable or burdensome for you due to any factor beyond your control, please come see me or email me. I am a very understanding person and am happy to work out a solution together. I reserve the right to modify and reweight assignments at my sole discretion for students that I belive would legitimately be at a disadvantage, through no fault of their own, to complete them as described.\nIf you are unable to afford required textbooks or other resources for any reason, come see me and we can find a solution that works for you.\nThis course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.\n ACBSP Information Hood College is an accredited member of the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP), an organization devoted to enhancing business education. In receiving and maintaining this accreditation, the faculty has made a commitment to the continuous improvement, innovation, and scholarship of the Department of Economics and Management. For you, this means that your educational experience undergoes ongoing validation to ensure it meets the most rigorous international standards of business education. Only a select group of institutions have received this status and it is an attribute of Hood for which you should take great pride.\nPragmatically, our accreditation means that we will engage in the ongoing use of measures, both quantitative and qualitative in nature, to assess the performance of our students and the program. We ask that you take very seriously the surveys and other measurement devices we will use – your best work and honest response will help us best assess and improve our program.\n  Tentative Schedule You can find a full schedule with much more details, including the readings, appendices, and other further resources for each class meeting on the schedule page.\n ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627055469,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"https://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Format and Covid Course objectives Required Course materials  Books Articles Software  Assignments and Grades Policies and Expectations  Late Assignments Grading Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Netiquette Privacy Enrollment Honor Code Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations ACBSP Information  Tentative Schedule   Instructor  Dr. Ryan Safner  Office: Rosenstock 218-B  Office Hours: TBD  safner@hood.edu  @ryansafner   Course details  TuTh 11:25 AM—12:50 PM  Rosenstock 1  Aug 23—Dec 14, 2021  Slack     Download PDF","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
