On paper. Yes. Studies show that using pen and paper trump taking notes on a device. The main reason is because you cannot possibly write down everything I am saying by hand. This forces you to selectively filter my lecture to its most essential and important components \u0026ndash; an integral part of the learning and retention process. If you are taking notes on a laptop, you become a court stenographer, thoughtlessly transcribing everything I am saying. At the other extreme, do not assume everything is written in my lecture slides. My lecture slides are visuals and cues to organize the content both for me and for you. I try hard to make sure that I have few words on slides, and even fewer answers to problems.  My suggestion: print out my lecture slides in advance (or follow along on your device) and take additional notes by hand.   At least skim all of the readings. I give out readings for a reason, and that reason is not to bore you or waste your time. The truth is, as a beginner, you can\u0026rsquo;t rely on heuristics or memory to \u0026ldquo;fill in the blanks.\u0026rdquo; You need the readings to provide context to what I am saying in class. I cannot help you if you are not going to try. Any professor also will lose patience at short notice when it\u0026rsquo;s discovered you haven\u0026rsquo;t done the reading. Do the homeworks (if there are any). You might be surprised that I need to say this, but I do. Students that do not do the homeworks do poorly on exams, which often are similar to homework questions. Homeworks are the best practice for exams, they give you a sense of the relevant content areas that might come up, the type and style of questions that I ask, and you often get answer keys to help you \u0026ldquo;get inside my head\u0026rdquo; and study from. There is no good reason why you should have a low homework grade. Work on assignments together and study together. Recognize that you are not in this alone, and other students are just as anxious or uncertain as you are. More surprisingly, other students probably have some answers you are looking for, and you may have answers for some of their problems! You will learn better when you collaborate with others similar to you. More importantly, you don\u0026rsquo;t truly understand something unless you can explain it to others.^[Yes, that means I am doing a ton of learning every time I teach!] As a wise woman once told me \u0026ldquo;whomever is doing the talking is doing the learning.\u0026rdquo; Learn how to learn. The most important skill you learn in college is how to learn. Taking a course on a subject will not make you an expert on that subject. It a) helps you recognize that you do not know everything on that subject, and this prevents you from actively saying stupid things; and b) gives you enough context and skills to figure out how to actually fill those gaps. This is the actual skill that\u0026rsquo;s relevant in the real world.^[Yes, Google is your best friend. But you do not yet know how to ask the right questions, or understand what constitutes good answers.]  ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1626808675,"objectID":"a8f2b974e9ce460bb770962ed237d1c6","permalink":"https://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/tips/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/resources/tips/","section":"resources","summary":"Take notes.

ICPSR is a database of datasets from published social science papers for the purposes of reproducibility. NHANES uses data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. ipumsr has census data from all around the world, in addition to the US census, American Community Survey, and Current Population Survey. If you’re doing international micro work, look at IPUMS. It’s also the easiest way to get the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is very popular for labor economics. Unfortunately ipumsr won’t get the data from within R; you’ll have to make your own data extract on the IPUMS website and download it. But ipumsr will read that file into R and preserve things like names and labels. education-data-package-r4 is the Urban Institute’s data data on educational institutions in the US, including colleges (in IPEDS) and K-12 schools (in CCD). This package also has data on county-level poverty rates from SAIPE. psidR is the Panel Study of Income Dynamics. This study doesn’t just follow people over their lifetimes, it follows their children too, generationally! A great source for studying how things follow families through generations. atus is th e American Time Use Survey, which is a large cross-sectional data set with information on how people spend their time. Rilostat uses data from the International Labor Organization. This contains lots of different statistics on labor, like employment, wage gaps, etc., generally aggregated to the national level and changing over time. democracyData5 is a great “package for accessing and manipulating existing measures of democracy.” politicaldata provides useful functions for obtaining commonly-used data in political analysis and political science, including from sources such as the Comparative Agendas Project (which provides data on politics and policy from 20+ countries), the MIT Election and Data Science Lab, and FiveThirtyEight.

Let’s start just by making a basic graph and saving it as an object called p. I have decided to map (aes()) each geom_point’s color to continent and size to pop:\nlibrary(gapminder) library(ggplot2) p\u0026lt;-ggplot(gapminder) + aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp) + geom_point(aes(size = pop, color = continent)) p Working with Scales I don’t like the default choices ggplot2 has made for my point sizes for population, or the way it depicts them (in scientific notation) on the legend.\nI will set my own scale by setting the breaks1 manually, according to a vector I define as: c(100000, 1000000, 100000000, 1000000000). So, I will use one point size for populations of 100 thousand, a bigger one for a million, a bigger one for 100 millions, and the biggest for 1 billion.\nI am going to label these (on my legend) as the following vector: c(\"\u0026lt;1 million\",\"1 million\",\"100 million\", \"1 billion\").\nLastly, I don’t think the size of the billion circle is big enough, a billion is a lot of people! So I will set the range of sizes from size 1 point to size 10 point.\nTo do this, I include all of this inside the scale_size command (because I am scaling the size of points):\n# let\u0026#39;s save this as p2 p2\u0026lt;-p+scale_size(breaks = c(100000, 1000000, 100000000, 1000000000), # cut offs labels=c(\u0026quot;\u0026lt;1 million\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;1 million\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;100 million\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1 billion\u0026quot;), # labels on legend range=c(1,10)) # min \u0026amp; max point size # let\u0026#39;s see what we did p2 This is also very hard to see the relationship (because it is nonlinear!). So I will rescale the x_axis logarithmically with base 10:\np2+scale_x_log10() Doing this already gives me a much clearer view of the relationship! But I don’t like the labels, or the breaks it has chosen, so I can customize them again:\np2+scale_x_log10( breaks = c(10^3, 10^4, 10^5), # 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 labels = scales::dollar) The scales package has a nice command to format labels, in this case I am calling the scales::dollar function to print dollar signs in front of my axes numbers. I could have done it manually instead by setting labels = c(\"$1,000\", \"$10,000\", \"$100,000\").\n  Subsetting Data We learn more about this in class 1.4 using tidyverse, but let’s only look at one year of data (there’s too much going on in this plot, especially with the large points, some points are covering other points). So let’s only look at the year 2007. I can do this in two ways:\nSubset the data, save the subsetted data as an object (I’ll call gap2007), plot with that object as my data:  library(tidyverse) gap2007 \u0026lt;- gapminder %\u0026gt;% filter(year == 2007) p2007 \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = gap2007)+ aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp) + geom_point(aes(size = pop, color = continent)) p2007 Subset data and pipe it directly into ggplot2’s data argument:  library(tidyverse) p2007 \u0026lt;- gapminder %\u0026gt;% filter(year == 2007) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(data = .)+ # . is placeholder aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp) + geom_point(aes(size = pop, color = continent)) p2007 Now let’s clean up the graph with the same things I did before, hide the legends (set the color and size, my two aesthetic mappings, guides equal to FALSE), add some labels, and change the theme:\np3\u0026lt;-p2007+scale_size(breaks = c(100000, 1000000, 100000000, 1000000000), labels=c(\u0026quot;\u0026lt;1 million\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;1 million\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;100 million\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;1 billion\u0026quot;), range=c(1,10))+ scale_x_log10( breaks = c(10^3, 10^4, 10^5), labels = scales::dollar)+ labs(x = \u0026quot;GDP per Capita (USD)\u0026quot;, y = \u0026quot;Life Expectancy (years)\u0026quot;)+ guides(color = FALSE, size = FALSE)+ theme_classic() ## Warning: `guides(\u0026lt;scale\u0026gt; = FALSE)` is deprecated. Please use `guides(\u0026lt;scale\u0026gt; = ## \u0026quot;none\u0026quot;)` instead. p3  ggrepel If I were to try to label some countries, with either geom_text (just word) or geom_label() (text in a box), setting the label aesthetic to country, see what would happen:\np3+geom_label(aes(label = country, color = continent)) The labels, which are plotted right on top of each point, cover the points!\nSomeone figured out a clever way to let us do both, and it is a package called ggrepel, which allows you to plot labels that are “repelled” away from the point they are labelling in an intelligent way. This is a separate package, which you must first install and then load with library to use it!\n# install.packages(\u0026quot;ggrepel\u0026quot;) # do this only once library(ggrepel) p3+geom_text_repel(aes(label = country, color = continent, size = pop), size = 3) ## Warning: ggrepel: 69 unlabeled data points (too many overlaps). Consider ## increasing max.overlaps This is much better, but for this particular chart, since a lot of observations are close together, it would be unwise to label everything, perhaps only label a subset of important points.\n ggflag One alternative is instead of points, to use some other marking. Someone created the ggflags package to let you plot flags of countries. This creates a new type of geom, called geom_flag, that requires you to map the country aesthetic to a variable in your data with the country name (incidentally, in gapminder that variable is also called country). Let’s try that out instead (and add my same customizations as above):\n# install.packages(\u0026quot;ggflags\u0026quot;) # do this only once library(ggflags) pflag\u0026lt;-p3+geom_flag(aes(country = country, size = pop)) pflag  plotly We can also make our plot a bit more interactive (on web only of course!) using the ggplotly package, which allows ggplot2 to interface with a javascript library called plotly.2\n# install.packages(\u0026quot;plotly\u0026quot;) # do this only once library(plotly) ggplotly(p3)

 Better barplots Another major type of plot that we may use often is a barplot. Suppose we want to show the GDP per Capita of the top 20 countries in 2007. If I were to plot country on the x axis and gdpPercap on the y axis with geom_col,3 I get the following mess:\nggplot(gap2007)+ aes(x = country, y = gdpPercap, fill = continent)+ geom_col() So let’s filter4 arrange our data in descending order by gdpPercap:\ngap2007 %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) ## # A tibble: 142 × 6 ## country continent year lifeExp pop gdpPercap ## \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;fct\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; ## 1 Norway Europe 2007 80.2 4627926 49357. ## 2 Kuwait Asia 2007 77.6 2505559 47307. ## 3 Singapore Asia 2007 80.0 4553009 47143. ## 4 United States Americas 2007 78.2 301139947 42952. ## 5 Ireland Europe 2007 78.9 4109086 40676. ## 6 Hong Kong, China Asia 2007 82.2 6980412 39725. ## 7 Switzerland Europe 2007 81.7 7554661 37506. ## 8 Netherlands Europe 2007 79.8 16570613 36798. ## 9 Canada Americas 2007 80.7 33390141 36319. ## 10 Iceland Europe 2007 81.8 301931 36181. ## # … with 132 more rows We only want the top 20 observations, so lets slice to extract just rows 1:20. Then we’ll pipe it into our plot:\nbar\u0026lt;-gap2007 %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %\u0026gt;% slice(1:20) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(data = .)+ aes(x = country, y = gdpPercap, fill = continent)+ geom_col() bar Now that’s closer to what we wanted! But here are a few more tips and tricks to make it better. First, let’s flip the axes to be able to read the countries better, using coord_flip()\nbar+coord_flip() One other useful thing to know would be how to display the bars in numerical order (from largest gdpPercap to smalleset gdpPercap) so we can get a clear ranking of countries. To do this, we are going to make use of another tidyverse package called forcats (dealing with factors), specifically the function fct_reorder(), which reorders a factor variable (our country) by the values of some other variable (our gdpPercap). We need to do this to our x variable aesthetic:\nbar2\u0026lt;-gap2007 %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %\u0026gt;% slice(1:20) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(data = .)+ aes(x = forcats::fct_reorder(country, gdpPercap), #\u0026lt;\u0026lt; y = gdpPercap, fill = continent)+ geom_col()+ coord_flip() bar2 This is already looking good. Here’s another creative way to depict the same thing in a more visually-striking way. Instead of using geom_bar(), let’s combine geom_flag (to serve as end points) and geom_segment()5 (line segments) to make the following version:\nbar3\u0026lt;-gap2007 %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(gdpPercap)) %\u0026gt;% slice(1:20) %\u0026gt;% ggplot(data = .)+ aes(x = forcats::fct_reorder(country, gdpPercap), #\u0026lt;\u0026lt; y = gdpPercap, fill = continent)+ geom_segment(aes(x = forcats::fct_reorder(country, gdpPercap), #\u0026lt;\u0026lt; y = 0, #\u0026lt;\u0026lt; xend = country, #\u0026lt;\u0026lt; yend = gdpPercap, #\u0026lt;\u0026lt; color = continent), #\u0026lt;\u0026lt; size = 1)+ #\u0026lt;\u0026lt; geom_flag(aes(country = country))+ #\u0026lt;\u0026lt; coord_flip() bar3   The cut offs for using one size circle vs. the next/previous size circle, depending on population.↩︎\n I am plotting our graph from above, not the flags, since ggflags has not been configured for plotly yet.↩︎\n Using geom_col() allows you to specify an x and a y variable. geom_bar() only plots the counts of each value on the x axis. If we had done +aes(x = country)+geom_bar(), it would plot the number of observations of each country in the data, not what we want!↩︎\n You learn about this in class 1.4↩︎\n Note because we are defining an x aesthetic again for this, we need to make sure x is also the reordered list of countries, so note I am doing the whole fct_reorder() again.↩︎\n   ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"a419ffeb40ed64d43521b8d8437e73a1","permalink":"https://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/ggplot2/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/resources/ggplot2/","section":"resources","summary":"Extensions to ggplot2 ggplot2, being one of the most popular packages, has a lot of user-made extensions that allow you to do lots of neat things with your plots, from plotting networks, Parliaments, dendrograms, and other types of graphs, to formatting and visual tools that help improve your figures.\nFor the following demonstrations, we will use the gapminder data.

Here are a few apps you can use:\n Scannable ^[If you use Evernote for notes (I do, it\u0026rsquo;s amazing), this can sync up and store your PDFs in Evernote] Turboscan  Image to PDF Converter Free  PDF Converter Pro  Simple Scan   Personally, I use Scannable — primarily because of its association with Evernote, if you wanted a recommendation. But note it does not exist on Android. I also have successfully used Turboscan in the past.\nAdditionally, as Hood students, you all have Onedrive, you can use the app on your phone to scan documents with photos and convert them to PDFs.\nUsing Images Sent to Your Computer Most modern versions of operating system have a built-in tool in the File Viewer (or Finder) menus, after clicking on one or multiple files, to create a PDF from the files.\nSo first take photos on your smartphone of your written work (one photo per page). Please try to frame your photos properly! Put your paper flat on a solid surface (table, desk, the floor, etc). Get the whole page within the borders of the photo, and not too much background. I don\u0026rsquo;t need to see half of your desk or bed as you are taking the photo! Take a look at it and make sure it is legible.\nNext, get the photos onto your computer (whether by Airdrop, email to yourself, Dropbox, etc.). Finally, depending on your OS, convert the files to a PDF:\n1. On a Windows PC\nOpen the folder where your photos are currently, in the File Explorer. Select all of the photos, and right click, and select Print. In the dialog box that pops up, select Microsoft Print to PDF in the Printer box, and then click Print. This will save it as a .pdf file in that folder. See more information.\n2. On a Mac\nAs I use a Mac, I will show you how Mac OS has a neat feature built into Finder, which allows converting multiple files into a single PDF file as a Quick Action. I have written two pages in a notebook and taken two separate pictures of them, and airdropped them onto my computer.\nHere is the  example PDF.\n3.

Think of R as the engine of a car, and R Studio as the dashboard.\nYou will need to install both, but we will ever only open R Studio.\nInstalling R First you will need to download and install R on your computer.\nGo to the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) that maintains R and its official packages at: https://cran.r-project.org Click on “Download R for …” your operating system (Mac or Windows)   If you use a Mac, scroll to the first .pkg file listed on the left and download. If you use Windows, click on base (“This what you want to install R for the first time”)  Install the downloaded package like you would any software application on your computer.   Typically, open the file from your Downloads folder (or whever you save downloaded files) and follow the prompts to install on your computer.  If you use a Mac, also download and install XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org/). You do not need to do this on Windows.   Install R Studio Go to RStudio.com and download the free desktop version. The website should automatically detect your operating system and give you a large button to click to download the application. Install the downloaded package like you would any software application on your computer.   R Studio Cloud R is free, but sometimes can be difficult to install and configure on your computer. To make things easier, and to ensure everyone has a consistent experience for class, you can (and should) use the free Rstudio.Cloud service initially. This allows you to run R in your browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc), meaning you don’t need to worry about installing things on your computer.\nGo to https://rstudio.cloud and create an account (please use your first and last name). I will send you a link via email to join our class workspace.\nR Studio Cloud is convenient, but is not designed to be as fully customizable and extensive as the main desktop version. I would start with the Cloud version if you have trouble with your own computer or computers on campus running R or R Studio. But ultimately, you will want to eventually do everything on your own computer and not the cloud version.\n ","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629937510,"objectID":"2774a692091b996921c7271a5f3e682c","permalink":"https://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/installing-r/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/resources/installing-r/","section":"resources","summary":"Installing R Install R Studio R Studio Cloud   We will do all of our work in this course with the free \u0026amp; open source programming language R.

Overview Today we begin the long slog to your mastery of R. We begin with the basics - how R works, how to use it, the different data types, and how to create and manipulate objects.\n  Readings  Ch.1 in Wickham \u0026amp; Grolemund, http://r4ds.had.co.nz/introduction.html  Now that we start working with R, you should consider this book to be your primary reference for R-related questions. We will broadly cover the first few chapters in order over the next 2-3 class periods.\n  Slides Below, you can find the slides in two formats.

Answers will be posted later on that page.\n  Assignments Preliminary Statistics Survey Due Sunday August 29 Please take the preliminary survey on your statistics and software background by 11:59 PM Sunday. This will help us all have a productive semester together.\n  Additional Useful Information Installing R and R Studio We will be using Rstudio.cloud, for which you have made a free account. However, since R is free, I strongly recommend you download and install it on your own computers. You may decide also you prefer to use your own computers in class when we work with R.\nInstall R from CRAN1 by clicking “Download R” (or the CRAN link under Downloads on the left menu). This will take you to a mirrors page, where you can select a location in the U.S. and download a copy of R Install R Studio (Desktop Version), choose the “Free” option  (This will also be posted on the Reference page.)\n R Packages Packages come from multiple sources.\nThe polished, publicly released versions are found on CRAN. When installing a package available on CRAN, it is sufficient simply to tell R the following:2\ninstall.packages(\u0026quot;packagename\u0026quot;)  Other packages, which may be in various developmental states (including perfectly functional!) are often hosted on GitHub before they make their way onto CRAN. Simply telling R install.packages(\"packagename\") will fail to find it (as R only looks in CRAN for packages), so you must use another package called devtools3 to install packages directly from Github:4\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;username/packagename\u0026quot;)  For example, to install Hadley Wickham’s package r4ds from its Github page https://github.com/hadley/r4ds, we would type:\ndevtools::install_github(\u0026quot;hadley/r4ds\u0026quot;) To use a package, you need to ensure it is loaded to your workspace (you only need to do this once)^[When we learn how to write R Markdown documents, . with library(\"package_name\").5\n  Getting Help for R For specific functions or commands, you can simply type:\n?functionname() # example ?mean() This will display a help page specific to that function in the Viewer pane. R functions and packages are extremely well-documented; help pages normally6 a short description of the function, arguments and options (as well as their default values), and several examples or vignettes to demonstrate usage of the function.\nAdditionally, you can turn to the community by searching on Google or better yet, StackExchange.\nOther Useful Commands to Know One of the best/worst things about R is that it is a language, meaning there are multiple ways that you can accomplish the same task. Here are a few alternative methods relevant to what we have learned so far that might prove useful.\nCreating Vectors We know vectors can be created with the c() command (and stored with = or \u0026lt;-), but there are other shortcuts to combine objects into a vector, particularly numeric data:\n: creates a series of integers  1:5 # create a vector of 1 through 5 ## [1] 1 2 3 4 5 12:17 # create a vector of 12 through 17 ## [1] 12 13 14 15 16 17  seq(from = , to = , by = ) creates a numeric sequence, and is not restricted to integers  seq(from = 1, to = 10, by = 2) # sequence from 1 to 10, by 2s ## [1] 1 3 5 7 9 # note you do not need to fully write out the name of each argument, just the input! seq(32.5,40,1.5) # sequence from 32.5 to 40, by 1.5 ## [1] 32.5 34.0 35.5 37.0 38.5 40.0 rep(., times =)7 repeats an element a specified number of times  rep(2, times = 4) # repeat \u0026quot;2\u0026quot; four times ## [1] 2 2 2 2 rep(2, 4) # does the same thing ## [1] 2 2 2 2 # the thing repeated could itself be a vector rep(c(1,4,7), 3) # repeat the vector \u0026quot;1, 4, 7\u0026quot; three times ## [1] 1 4 7 1 4 7 1 4 7 We can combine these:  # combine (the sequence of 4 to 8 by 2\u0026#39;s repeated three times) and 1 and 5 c(rep(seq(4,8,2),3),1,5) ## [1] 4 6 8 4 6 8 4 6 8 1 5   Suggested Style Guide for Coding We want to maximize human-readability of code, not just machine-readability. I try to follow Hadley Wickham’s style guide for all of my code, including that in this class.\nYou will not be graded on the style of your code. But now’s the best time to learn best practices (while you don’t know any alternatives!) to save yourself and your potential colleagues (including your future self) from unnecessary frustration.\n comment above for overall idea comment on side for individual elements of long commands name with _ use %\u0026gt;% wherever possible spaces betweeen all operators: \u0026lt;-, =, +, etc.  Exception: : and ::  line breaks between multiple arguments to a function  p\u0026lt;-ggplot(data=data, aes(x=x,y=y,fill=fill))+geom_point() becomes\np \u0026lt;- ggplot(data = data, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = fill))+ geom_point()    The Comprehensive R Archive Network↩︎\n Note the plural s on packages, and the quotes around the “package name”↩︎\n Which you will need to install first if you (probably) don’t already have it!↩︎\n Note the :: allows you to use the function install_github() from the devtools package without having to first load the devtools package with library(devtools).↩︎\n Quotes are not necessary this time.↩︎\n This useful guide comes from Kieran Healy’s excellent (free online!) book on Data Visualization.↩︎\n The . is a placeholder here.↩︎\n   ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629988335,"objectID":"eab062b2028198d6033d10ca4130c899","permalink":"https://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/content/1.2-content/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/content/1.2-content/","section":"content","summary":"Overview  Readings  Slides  R Practice  Assignments  Preliminary Statistics Survey Due Sunday August 29  Additional Useful Information  Installing R and R Studio R Packages  Getting Help for R  Other Useful Commands to Know Suggested Style Guide for Coding     Thursday, August 26, 2021    Please complete the preliminary survey by Sunday August 29.

At the end, save it, and run to execute all of your commands at once.\n“Our Plot” from Class   R Script  Download and run in R Studio on your computer (or open the file in our R Studio cloud project and run it there) to see our plot from class.\n  Exploring the Data Question 1 We will look at GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy using some data from the gapminder project. There is a handy package called gapminder that uses a small snippet of this data for exploratory analysis. Install and load the package gapminder. Type ?gapminder and hit enter to see a description of the data.\n Question 2 Let’s get a quick look at gapminder to see what we’re dealing with.\nGet the structure of the gapminder data. What variables are there? Look at the head of the dataset to get an idea of what the data looks like. Get summary statistics of all variables.    Simple Plots in Base R Question 3 Let’s make sure you can do some basic plots before we get into the gg. Use base R’s hist() function to plot a histogram of gdpPercap.\n Question 4 Use base R’s boxplot() function to plot a boxplot of gdpPercap.\n Question 5 Now make it a boxplot by continent. Hint: use formula notation with ~.\n Question 6 Now make a scatterplot of gdpPercap on the \\(x\\)-axis and LifeExp on the \\(y\\)-axis.\n  Plots with ggplot2 Question 7 Load the package ggplot2 (you should have installed it previously. If not, install first with install.packages(\"ggplot2\")).\n Question 8 Let’s first make a bar graph to see how many countries are in each continent. The only aesthetic you need is to map continent to x. Bar graphs are great for representing categories, but not quantitative data.\n Question 9 For quantitative data, we want a histogram to visualize the distribution of a variable. Make a histogram of gdpPercap. Your only aesthetic here is to map gdpPercap to x.\n Question 10 Now let’s try adding some color, specifically, add an aesthetic that maps continent to fill. (In general, color refers to the outside borders of a geom (except points), fill is the interior of an object.)\n Question 11 Instead of a histogram, change the geom to make it a density graph. To avoid overplotting, add alpha=0.4 to the geom argument (alpha changes the transparency of a fill).\n Question 12 Redo your plot from 11 for lifeExp instead of gdpPercap.\n Question 13 Now let’s try a scatterplot for lifeExp (as y) on gdpPercap (as x). You’ll need both for aesthetics. The geom here is geom_point().\n Question 14 Add some color by mapping continent to color in your aesthetics.\n Question 15 Now let’s try adding a regression line with geom_smooth(). Add this layer on top of your geom_point() layer.\n Question 16 Did you notice that you got multiple regression lines (colored by continent)? That’s because we set a global aesthetic of mapping continent to color. If we want just one regression line, we need to instead move the color = continent inside the aes of geom_point. This will only map continent to color for points, not for anything else.\n Question 17 Now add an aesthetic to your points to map pop to size.\n Question 18 Change the color of the regression line to \"black\". Try first by putting this inside an aes() in your geom_smooth, and try a second time by just putting it inside geom_smooth without an aes(). What’s the difference, and why?\n Question 19 Another way to separate out continents is with faceting. Add +facet_wrap(~continent) to create subplots by continent.\n Question 20 Remove the facet layer. The scale is quite annoying for the x-axis, a lot of points are clustered on the lower level. Let’s try changing the scale by adding a layer: +scale_x_log10().\n Question 21 Now let’s fix the labels by adding +labs(). Inside labs, make proper axes titles for x, y, and a title to the plot. If you want to change the name of the legends (continent color), add one for color and size.\n Question 22 Now let’s try subsetting by looking only at North America. Take the gapminder dataframe and subset it to only look at continent==\"Americas\"). Assign this to a new dataframe object (call it something like america.) Now, use this as your data, and redo the graph from question 17. (You might want to take a look at your new dataframe to make sure it worked first!)\n Question 23 Try this again for the whole world, but just for observations in the year 2002.\n  ","date":1591574400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630381769,"objectID":"52cfe5fe59880af539a400a51f8dfd0a","permalink":"https://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/r/1.3-r/","publishdate":"2020-06-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/r/1.3-r/","section":"r","summary":"Download PDF Getting Set Up Before we begin, start a new file with File \\(\\rightarrow\\) New File \\(\\rightarrow\\) R Script.

M. Forster\n  “No economist has achieved scientific success as a result of a statistically significant coefficient. Massed observations, clever common sense, elegant theorems, new policies, sagacious economic reasoning, historical perspective, relevant accounting, these have all led to scientific success. Statistical significance has not.” — McCloskey and Ziliak, “The Cult of Statistical Significance” (1996: 112)\n  Writing and Reading Empirical Papers Slides](/slides/paper-slides.html) - [ Example Paper Project](https://github.com/ryansafner/example_empirical_paper)-- Overview Your task is to write a research paper on any topic in political economy of your choosing so long as it has an empirical component. The purpose of this paper is threefold: (1) to demonstrate to me that you have mastered the material of this course, (2) to develop your writing, communication, and data analysis skills, and (3) to help you develop, strengthen, and/or modify your own views by grappling with them in writing. As a reminder, this paper constitutes 25% of your final course grade.\nI will spend a significant portion of one class discussing more about the writing process, and provide a detailed guide to help you choose a topic, craft arguments, and write a good paper.\nI am NOT looking for a survey of existing research, a series of block quotes showing what some economist said about X, a regurgitation of my lectures, a list of pros and cons with a last minute conclusion, a book review, and so on. I also do NOT want you to compress everything about econometrics you learned from this class into a single paper. You should only use those insights that are relevant to your topic and your argument (it may only be one or two things!).\nI am looking for a paper that attempts to answer a specific research question of interest to economists by using data analysis. You should be able to summarize your paper in one or two sentences – the specific research question your paper addresses, your method for answering it, and your results. It should be a reasonably original paper (it is difficult with limited knowledge, time, and data to offer something truly original), and it should be your own take on the topic. I expect you to, at the very least, have one multivariate regression used to reach your conclusions. I do not expect or require you to find statistically significant results.\nPlease note that, while you are not required to, I highly recommend discussing your ideas with me over email or in person. I will also read any drafts you would like to submit to me early, and provide you with helpful comments, subject to my own availability. I will stop accepting drafts to provide comments by November 30.\n Length, References, \u0026amp; Mechanics I hesitate to give formal length requirements, because most students will write the bare minimum, and also because different papers have different optimal lengths. What truly matters is that your paper is long enough to say what you need to say, to say it well, and to say it briefly. Ceterus paribus, if papers \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) say the same thing, but paper \\(B\\) says it in half the length (without sacrificing key arguments), paper \\(B\\) is a better paper. You will also find that simply by including the necessary components of an empirical paper (plots, tables, etc.), your page count will by necessity increase on its own.\nSince you of course still want to know what a good length will be, my rule of thumb is that your paper should be about \\(\\mathbf{10\\pm 5}\\) pages (size 12 font, double spaced, 1\" margins). This will depend on the topic you have chosen to written on, your data, and your own personal writing style.\nI would also like you to use scholarly references, that is, articles from economics journals and cite them properly. I do not have a minimum requirement of the amount of references, but I expect you to have at least 2-5 scholarly references, depending on your paper topic and thesis. I am not particularly picky about exactly how you format your citations or bibliography, just please be consistent, and do not use footnotes or endnotes (only because they annoy me). I suggest the APA author-year-page in-text citation format that is fairly standard in economics journals, i.e.: “The division of labor is limited by the extent of the market,” (Smith 1776: 27). Look at my slides or my handouts for a suggested bibliography style. If you use .bib files, the default formatting is fine.\n Sources for Inspiration Here is a list of a few places you might consider to dig up some information on your topic, or to help you find a topic. Just be sure to read and cite the actual sources that these secondary sources cite.\n Major news outlets (e.g. CNN, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, USA Today, Huffington Post, the Guardian) and wherever you may find your news (e.g. reddit, Buzzfeed, etc) both for current events, and also their Opinion/Commentary sections for other op-eds to learn from and/or critique Wikipedia – no seriously, it is the first place I go to learn about a new topic. Just be sure to actually investigate the underlying research and use that for your references! Economics Podcasts  Econtalk – a fantastic podcast series by Russ Roberts that interviews famous economists, philosophers, businesspeople, and other figures who have an impact on the world of ideas Freakonomics (Radio) – another great podcast by one of the authors of the famed Freakonomics books about intermediate-level economic topics, often an in-depth series of interviews on a major issue NPR Planet Money – another good podcast series on economics topics and current events, much shorter and more 10,000-foot level approach than Econtalk or Freakonomics  Popular Economists’ Blogs/Blogs on Economics:  Marginal Revolution – Tyler Cowen \u0026amp; Alex Tabarrok (head and shoulders above the rest!) Cafe Hayek – Don Boudreaux (libertarian-leaning, mostly just Don on trade and micro-policy) EconLog – Bryan Caplan, David Henderson (libertarian-leaning, good analysis) The Conscience of a Liberal – Paul Krugman at New York Times (strong left-wing politics) The Grumpy Economist – John Cochrane (Chicago School approach) Greg Mankiw’s Blog – Greg Mankiw (moderate conservative, New Keynesian approach) Undercover Economist – Tim Harford (British, non-political, very easy to understand) Chris Blattman – Chris Blattman (great on economic development, poverty, and conflict in poor countries) Slate Star Codex – “Scott Alexander” (a pseudonym, apparently a Medical Student, but one of the most lucid social science blogs ever written) Fivethirtyeight – Nate Silver \u0026amp; co. (a journalist, but a leader on using data and statistics in social science and journalism) Andrew Gelman – Andrew Gelman (a statistician, but another leader on using data and statistics for social science)    Data Sources While it is one thing to find a topic to write on, it is an altogether different animal to find data to use to test empirical research questions. You will find out quickly that the constraint to writing an empirical paper is not the set of topics or questions to write on (though that is often a challenge itself!), but the data available to use.\nDepending on the topic, you can also collect your own data, and many times you will want to create a custom dataset by simply combining data from different sources.\nDon’t forget to check out the Data Resources for ideas and examples of how and where to find data sets.\n Grading Rubric and Deadlines While it may be possible for many papers in your college career, is not a paper you can write the last minute and do well on. To ensure that you do not get too far behind, I have split the assignment into stages that are due at different intervals over the semester. Note that your topic can and may change depending on what you are able to find and work with. The hardest part is finding data that allows you to test a research question. It is primarily for this reason that writing an empirical paper on what you want is very difficult.\n    Assignment Points Due Date Description    Abstract 5 Sun Oct 11 Short summary of your ideas  Literature Review 10 Sun Nov 1 1-3 paragraphs on 2-3 scholarly sources  Data Description 10 Sun Nov 15 Description of data sources, and some summary statistics  Presentation 5 Thurs Nov 19 Short presentation of your project so far  Final Paper Due 70 Tues Nov 22 Email to me paper, data, and code    All assignments are due by emails to me.\n Abstract: write a short paragraph (3-6 sentences) summarizing: what rough topic you want to look at, a specific research question that you think you can get data to test, where you think you might be able to get some data. It’s okay that much of this is speculative and you might change your mind or do very different things later!\n Data Description: describe what data you managed to find (a few paragraphs): where is/are the dataset(s) from? What variables are included, and how are they measured (e.g. what units, categories, etc)? Give us some summary statistics of the data (a table would be nice, some scatterplots and histograms would be nice), are there any interesting patterns?\n Literature Review: find 2-3 scholarly sources (ideally scholarly journal articles) that discuss your research question (or related topics), especially if they have empirical findings. Explain what these sources found, how they found it, and how your paper relates to this literature. Don’t worry about being original!\n Presentation: a 5-10 minute presentation of what you have so far. Different people will be at different stages, since your paper is not due yet! Use this as an opportunity to get feedback from me and your classmates, that might help you finish your project. Using some slides to show tables, models, and plots is highly recommended.  Example](/papers/Presentation_example.pdf) --\n Final Paper Due: email the full paper to me (see below for what should be in the email).\n  The remaining 70% for the final product are broken down as follows:\n  Category Points    Persuasiveness 10  Clarity 10  Econometric Validity 20  Economic Soundness 20  Organization 5  References 5  TOTAL 70     Persuasiveness: How persuasive is your argument? Would a reasonably educated college-level reader who is familiar with economics and statistics but not necessarily this course find themselves understanding your argument and agreeing with you? [Write for an audience wider than just members of this class. Therefore, don’t use terms, sources, or “inside jokes” that only other students in this class (and no one else) would understand.] Remember, your goal is not to convince me (though you may), your goal is to convince any educated reader, and I grade you the probability that this is likely. You are the lawyer, I am the judge, and your audience is the jury. Clarity How clear is your paper? Is it clear what your research question is, how you answer it, and what your results are? Can you summarize these in a sentence or two? Are there confusing passages, excessive jargon or passive voice, or irrelevant arguments and examples? Econometric Validity: Is your econometric model sensible and plausible? Do you adequately address the assumptions and limitations of your model? Do you use appropriate data? Do you adequately describe your data, identify patterns, aberrations, and clearly generate testable hypotheses from your data? Would someone else, given your data, be able to replicate your findings? Economic Soundness: Do you place your empirical question in a broader context of applying economic principles? Do you describe relevant economic policies, institutions, relationships, and/or other relevant economic principles to the questions you are asking? Are your theories and hypotheses about relationships between data plausible and intuitive? Do you makes sense of your hypotheses and the results of your analysis and connect them to sound economic principles? Is your question, strategy, and/or results of interest to economists? You will lose up to 20 points for papers that have no economic content. Organization: Is your paper organized? Have you presented your separate arguments/examples in a logical order? Is it clear when you are moving on from one section to another? Is it clear when and where you are summarizing and concluding? Is your paper presented according to professional norms (e.g. summary statistics tables, regression tables, etc)? References: Does your paper use multiple scholarly references? Does it properly cite them in the text for main ideas borrowed and for direct quotations (if applicable)? Are they consistently listed at the end in a references section? Style: Is your paper interesting and easy to read? Does it engage the reader? Is it written in active voice? This is somewhat subjective, and hence, the smallest portion of your grade.   Emailing Your Final Version to Me When you send your final email (by Tuesday November 22), it should contain the following files:\nYour final paper as a .pdf. It should include an abstract and bibliography and all tables and figures contained within it. The (commented!) code used for your data analysis (i.e. loading data, making tables, making plots, running regressions). These can be either .R files: one or multiple (one-per-task) are equally fine OR a .Rmd file. I want to know how you reached the results you got! Reproducibility is the goal! Your data used, in whatever original format you found it (e.g. .csv, .xlsx, .dta)  Again, you are not obligated to use R Markdown to write your paper.

It uses real data to test economic hypotheses, quantitatively estimate causal relationships between economic variables, and to make forecasts of future events. The primary tool that economists use for empirical analysis is ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression, so the majority of this course will focus on understanding, applying, and extending OLS regressions.\nI assume you have some working knowledge of economics at the intermediate level and some basic statistical tools.The formal prerequisites for this course are ECON 205 and ECON 206; ECMG 212 or MATH 112; and ECON 305 or ECON 306. We will do some basic review of some necessary statistics and probability at the beginning until everyone is comfortable, before jumping right into regressions.\nCourse Format (and Covid) As of Fall 2021, all students are expected to be on campus except those with special approved exemptions. As such, this course will be taught in-person and synchronously until or unless otherwise announced.\nYou are expected to come to class except due to medical reasons or other legitimate conflicts. Watching videos are not a substitute for attending class.1 Please see the attendance policy for more.\nIn any event that we are unable to meet in person, I will hold class meetings at the same day/time live on Zoom, and post all recorded lectures via Panopto on Blackboard, and all assignments will be submitted online (often via Blackboard).\nLearning During a Global Pandemic While we have made some progress in returning to normal, this remains a unique semester and a lot of things are still awful right now. None of us signed up for this. None of us are really okay, we’re all just pretending for everyone else.\nMany of you may be dealing with hardships at home and at work, and are generally juggling many more problems than usual. Everyone’s future plans have been completely put on hold or cancelled to a large degree.\nI am prioritizing us supporting each other as human beings during this crazy era, and will try to use simple, accessible solutions that make sense for the most people, and above all, to be flexible.\nIf you tell me you’re having trouble, I will do whatever I can to help, and not judge you or think less of you. I hope you will extend me the same courtesy.\nYou never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical). You are however always welcome to talk to me about things that you’re going through. If I can’t help you, I usually know somebody who can.\nI want you to learn a lot from this course, but it is more important for you to remain healthy, balanced, and grounded during this crisis.\nI reserve the right to change any part of this syllabus and course, at my discretion, with proper advance warning.\n  Course objectives By the end of this course, you will:\nunderstand how to evaluate statistical and empirical claims; use the fundamental models of causal inference and research design; gather, analyze, and communicate with real data in R.  I am less concerned with forcing you to memorize and recite proofs of statistical estimator properties, and more concerned with the development of your intuitions and the ability to think critically as an empirical social scientist—although this will require you to demonstrate proficiency with some intermediate statistical and mathematical tools.\nGiven these objectives, this course fulfills all three of the learning outcomes for the George B. Delaplaine, Jr. School of Business Economics B.A. program:\n Use quantitative tools and techniques in the preparation, interpretation, analysis and presentation of data and information for problem solving and decision making […] Apply economic reasoning and models to understand and analyze problems of public policy […] Demonstrate effective oral and written communications skills for personal and professional success[…]  Fair warning: Econometrics is hard. It will be one of the hardest economics courses that you will take, primarily due to the mathematical content. I will do my best to make this class intuitive and helpful, if not interesting. If at any point you find yourself struggling in this course for any reason, please come see me. Do not suffer in silence! Coming to see me for help does not diminish my view of you, in fact I will hold you in higher regard for understanding your own needs and taking charge of your own learning. There are also a some fantastic resources on campus, such as the Center for Academic Achievement and Retention (CAAR) and the Beneficial-Hodson Library.\nSee my tips for success in this course.\n Required Course materials This course requires regular online internet access. If you know you will be unable to access the internet regularly, please let me know and we can make arrangements.\nYou can find all course materials at my dedicated website for this course: metricsF21.classes.ryansafner.com. Links to the website are posted on our Blackboard course page. Please familiarize yourself with the website, see that it contains this syllabus, resources to help you, and our schedule. On the schedule page, you can find each module with its own class page (start there!) along with all related readings, lecture slides, practice problems, and assignments.\nMy lecture slides will be shared with you, and serve as your primary resource, but our main “textbook” below is recommended as the next best resource and will be available from the campus bookstore. I will discuss more about textbooks and materials in the first module.\nBooks The following book is required and will be available from the campus bookstore. (You are not obligated to buy it, I just strongly recommend it in the sense that you will still have access to all data and assignments without possessing the book. But this is a course where you really will want to understand the derivations or get additional context beyond just my slides…)\n Bailey, Michael A, 2019, Real Econometrics, New York: Oxford University Press, 2nd ed.  You are welcome to purchase the book by other means (e.g. Amazon, half.com, etc). I have no financial stake in requiring you to purchase this book. The (cheaper) 1st edition is sufficient, but makes significantly less use of R (in favor of STATA).\nThe following two books are recommended, and are free online. (You can purchase a hard copy of the first one if you really want.):\n Grolemund, Garrett and Hadley Wickham, R For Data Science Ismay, Chester and Albert Y Kim, Modern Dive: Statistical Inference Via Data Science  The first book is the number one resource for using R and tidyverse, and is written for beginners. I still look at it frequently. The second is another great reference for using tidyverse in the context of basic statistics.\n Articles Throughout the course, I will post both required and supplemental (non-required) readings that enrich your understanding for each topic.\n Software You are strongly recommended to download copies of R and R Studio on your own computers. These software packages are available on all computers in the trading room, and you will have access to them during the week to work on assignments.\nWe will also have a shared class workspace in RStudio.cloud that runs a full instance of R Studio in your web browser (so no need to install anything!) will let you access files and assignments.\n  Assignments and Grades Your final course grade is the weighted average of the following assignments. You can find general descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page and more specific information (such as due dates) and examples on each assignment’s page on the schedule page.\n   Frequency  Assignment  Weight      1  Research Project  30%    n  Problem sets (Average)  25%    1  Midterm  20%    1  Final  25%     Each assignment is graded on a 100 point scale. Letter-grade equivalents are based on the following scale:\n  Grade  Range  Grade  Range      A  93–100%  C  73–76%    A−  90–92%  C−  70–72%    B+  87–89%  D+  67–69%    B  83–86%  D  63–66%    B−  80–82%  D−  60–62%    C+  77–79%  F  \u0026lt; 60%     See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\nThese grades are firm cutoffs, but I do of course round upwards \\((\\geq\\) 0.5) for final grades. A necessary reminder, as an academic, I am not in the business of giving out grades, I merely report the grade that you earn. I will not alter your grade unless you provide a reasonable argument that I am in error (which does happen from time to time).\nSave As - PDF, or File - Export - PDF.] to **upload on Blackboard** under Assignments. You may handwrite answers if you will be able to scan/photograph \u0026 convert them **to a single PDF**, if they are easily readable, but this is *not preferred*. See my [guide to making a PDF](https://gameF21.classes.ryansafner.com/resources/#how-to-make-a-pdf-for-submitting-assignments) - an essential skill in the modern world. If you are handwriting answers, you may print the `pdf` above and write on it, or just write on a piece of paper (we only need your answers). For the few questions that ask you to draw a **graph**, *try* to do so *on your computer* (use MS Paint, the drawing tools in MS Word or MS Powerpoint, plot points in MS Excel, drawing/notetaking apps, etc.), and save it as an image to include on your homework document. Again, they need not be perfect or to scale, just show that you understand the broad idea. Being able to understand and sketch the graphs is still a very important and useful skill! If all else fails, I will be lenient in grading graph questions if you are unable to technologically include a graph. Your TA, under my supervision, will grade homeworks 70% for completion, and for the remaining 30%, and one question will be graded for accuracy - so it is best that you try every problem, even if you are unsure how to complete it accurately. ## Exams There will be three exams (one at the end of each unit) including the final exam. Each exam only covers the material in its associated unit (i.e. no exam is cumulative). These exams provide feedback both to you and to me that ensures everyone is progressing on schedule and apprehending the material. This is critical, as the rest of the course, and indeed, any future economics course you take, will build off of this foundation. Exams will be released **on Blackboard** as a timed assignment. You will have 2 hours once you open the exam on Blackboard. You will not need the whole time, I have given you some extra to accommodate the difficulties of taking an exam at home. Please pick a time to take it where you know you will have 2 hours. You may close the exam page and come back to it, but the timer will continue to run once the exam is first opened. ## Opinion-Editorial Economic fallacies have always been popular, and journalists, politicians, and talking heads consistently engage in faulty economic reasoning in print and on television. Your task, as a student of economics, is to find some issue discussed in the past year, and write a critique of media discussion of that issue. Alternatively, instead of critiquing the reasoning or statements of others, you may write an advocacy piece, where you propose some economic policy and argue to persuade readers to endorse it. You will be graded both on the soundness of your economic reasoning and the quality of your writing. I would be happy to co-author an Op-Ed with anyone who writes an exemplary Op-Ed. Students who successfully publish their work in a media outlet will earn *extra credit* on their Op-Ed grade. I will provide ample resources and examples to help you accomplish this, you can find more on the associated [assignment page](assignment/op-ed). -- No extra credit is available\n Policies and Expectations This syllabus is a contract between you, the student, and me, your instructor. It has been carefully and deliberately thought out. (A syllabus can and will be used as a legal document for disputes tried at a court of law. Ask me how I know.), and I will uphold my end of the agreement and expect you to uphold yours.\nIn the language of game theory, this syllabus is my commitment device. I am a very understanding person, and I know that exceptions to rules often need to be made for students. However, to be fair to all students the syllabus artificially constrains my ability to make exceptions at a whim for anyone. This prevents clever students from exploiting my congenial personality at everyone else’s expense. Please read and familiarize yourself with the course policies and expectations of you. Chances are, if you have a question, it is answered herein.\nAttendence Your day-to-day classroom attendance is not graded. My philosophy is that you are all adults and must take ownership of your own learning or else you will not succeed. Some assignments may require in-class participation for credit, and an (unexcused) absence may be detrimental to your grade. Attending class is one of the strongest predictors of success.\nHowever, as required under Hood College’s “Promise of Fall Plan,” (Ch. 2-C) your classroom attendance will be recorded at every class meeting. This is primarily to facilitate contact tracing.\nIf you know you will be absent, you are not required to let me know, but it is polite to give notice (Note if I do not reply to an email of yours letting me know, I am probably busy but will still see it and appreciate your email). Your absence will be noted and recorded for the purposes stated above. If, however, we have an assignment due in class, you must notify me ahead of time in order to make alternate arrangements to still receive credit. Hasty ex-post attempts to notify me will generate little sympathy.\n Late Assignments I will accept late assignments, but will subtract a specified amount of points as a penalty. Even if it is the last week of the semester, I encourage you to turn in late work: some points are better than no points!\nHomeworks: If you turn in a homework after it is due but before it is graded or the answer key posted, I generally will not take off any points. However, if you turn in a homework after the answer key is posted, I will automatically deduct 15 points (so the maximum grade you can earn on it is an 80).\nExams: If you know that you will be unable to complete an in-class exam as scheduled for a legitimate reason, please notify me at least one week in advance, and we will schedule a make-up exam date. Failure to do so, including desperate attempts to make arrangements only after the exam will result in a grade of 0 and little sympathy.\nPapers: Starting at the deadline, I will take off 1 point for every hour that your assignment is late.\nI reserve the right to re-weight assignments for students whom I believe are legitimately unable to complete a particular assignment.\n Grading I will try my best to post grades on Blackboard’s Grading Center and return graded assignments to you within about one week of you turning them in. There will be exceptions. Where applicable, I will post answer keys once I know most homeworks are turned in (see Late Assignments above for penalties). Blackboard’s Grading Center is the place to look for your most up-to-date grades. See also my  Grade Calculator app where you can calculate your overall grade using existing assignment grades and forecast “what if” scenarios.\n Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Students must regularly monitor their Hood email accounts to receive important college information, including messages related to this class. Email through the Blackboard system is my main method of communicating announcements and deadlines regarding your assignments. Please do not reply to any automated Blackboard emails - I may not recieve it!. My Hood email (safner@hood.edu) is the best means of contacting me. I will do my best to respond within 24 hours. If I do not reply within 48 hours, do not take it personally, and feel free to send a follow up email in the very likely event that I genuinely did not see your original message.\nOur slack channel is available to all students and faculty in Economics and Business. I have invited all of my classes and advisees. It will not be extended to non-Business/Economics students or faculty. All users must use their hood emails and true first and last names. Each course has its own channel, exclusive for verified students in the course, and myself, by my invite only. As a third party platform, you agree to its Terms of Service. I have created this space as a way to stay connected, to help one another, and to foster community. Behaviors such as posting inappropriate content, harassing others, or engaging in academic dishonesty, to be determined solely at my discretion, will result in one warning, the content will be deleted, and subsequent behavior will result in a ban.\nIn addition to in-person office hours, you can also make an appointment for “office hours” on Zoom. You can join in with video, audio, and/or chat, whichever you feel comfortable with. Of course, if you are not available during those times, we can schedule our own time if you prefer this method over email or Slack. If you want to go over material from class, please have specific questions you want help with. I am not in the business of giving private lectures (particularly if you missed class without a valid excuse).\nWatch this excellent and accurate video explaining office hours:\n  Netiquette When using Zoom and Slack, please follow appropriate internet etiquette (“Netiquette”). Written communications, like blog posts or use of the Zoom chat, lacks important nonverbal cues (such as body language, tone of voice, sarcasm, etc).\nAbove all else, please respect one another and think/reread carefully about how others may see your post before you submit a comment. You are expected to disagree and have different opinions, this is inherently valuable in a discussion. Please be civil and constructive in responding to others’ comments: writing “have you considered ‘X?’” is a lot more helpful to all involved than just writing “well you’re just wrong.”\nPosting content that is wilfully incindiary, illegal, or that constitutes academic dishonesty (such as plagarism) will automatically earn a grade of 0 and may be elevated to other authorities on campus.\nWhen using the chat function on Zoom or public Slack channels, please treat it as official course communications, even though I may not be grading it. It may be a quick and informal tool - don’t feel you need to worry about spelling or perfect grammar - but please try to avoid too informal “text-speak” (i.e. say “That’s good for you” instead of “thas good 4 u”).\n Privacy Maryland law requires all parties consent for a conversation or meeting to be recorded. If you join in, and certainly if you participate, you are consenting to be recorded. However, as described below, videos are not accessible beyond our class.\nLive lectures are recorded on Zoom and posted to Blackboard via Panopto, a secure course management system for video. Among other nice features (such as multiple video screens, close captioning, and time-stamped search functions!), Panopto is authenticated via your Blackboard credentials, ensuring that our course videos are not accessible to the open internet.\nFor the privacy of your peers, and to foster an environment of trust and academic freedom to explore ideas, do not record our course lectures or discussions. You are already getting my official copies.\nThe Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act prevents me from disclosing or discussing any student information, including grades and records about student performance. If the student is at least 18 years of age, parents (or spouses) do not have a right to obtain this information, except with consent by the student.\nMany of you may be tuning in remotely, living with parents, and may have occasional interruptions due to sharing a space. This is normal and fine, but know that I will protect your privacy and not discuss your performance when parents (or anyone other than you, for that matter) are present, without your explicit consent.\n Enrollment Students are responsible for verifying their enrollment in this class. The last day to add or drop this class with no penalty is Wednesday, September 1. Be aware of important dates.\n Honor Code Hood College has an Academic Honor Code which requires all members of this community to maintain the highest standards of academic honesty and integrity. Cheating, plagiarism, lying, and stealing are all prohibited. All violations of the Honor Code are taken seriously, will be reported to appropriate authority, and may result in severe penalties, including expulsion from the college. See here for more detailed information.\n Van Halen and M\u0026amp;Ms When you have completed reading the syllabus, email me a picture of the band Van Halen and a picture of a bowl of M\u0026amp;Ms. If you do this before the date of the first exam, you will get bonus points on the exam. If 75-100% of the class does this, you each get 2 points. If 50-75% of the class does this, you each get 4 points. If 25-50% of the class does this, you each get 6 points. If 0-25% of the class does this, you each get 8 points. Yes, you read this correctly.\n Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations College courses can, and should, be challenging and bring you out of your comfort zone in a safe and equitable environment. If, however, you feel at any point in the semester that certain assignments or aspects of the course will be disproportionately uncomfortable or burdensome for you due to any factor beyond your control, please come see me or email me. I am a very understanding person and am happy to work out a solution together. I reserve the right to modify and reweight assignments at my sole discretion for students that I belive would legitimately be at a disadvantage, through no fault of their own, to complete them as described.\nIf you are unable to afford required textbooks or other resources for any reason, come see me and we can find a solution that works for you.\nThis course is intended to be accessible for all students, including those with mental, physical, or cognitive disabilities, illness, injuries, impairments, or any other condition that tends to negatively affect one’s equal access to education. If at any point in the term, you find yourself not able to fully access the space, content, and experience of this course, you are welcome to contact me to discuss your specific needs. I also encourage you to contact the Office of Accessibility Services (301-696-3421). If you have a diagnosis or history of accommodations in high school or previous postsecondary institutions, Accessibility Services can help you document your needs and create an accommodation plan. By making a plan through Accessibility Services, you can ensure appropriate accommodations without disclosing your condition or diagnosis to course instructors.\n  Tentative Schedule You can find a full schedule with much more details, including the readings, appendices, and other further resources for each class meeting on the schedule page.\n  On average, even for students who complete all assignments, those that do not regularly attend class suffer by a full letter grade, (Levitt 1993).↩︎\n   ","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629566402,"objectID":"e4d5a4a79239f08c6ad0d7cbf1be756c","permalink":"https://metricsf21.classes.ryansafner.com/syllabus/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/syllabus/","section":"","summary":"Course Format (and Covid)  Learning During a Global Pandemic  Course objectives Required Course materials  Books Articles Software  Assignments and Grades Policies and Expectations  Attendence Late Assignments Grading Communication: Email, Slack, and Virtual Office Hours Netiquette Privacy Enrollment Honor Code Accessibility, Equity, and Accommodations  Tentative Schedule   Instructor  Dr. Ryan Safner  Office: Rosenstock 218-B  Office Hours: TBD  safner@hood.","tags":null,"title":"Syllabus","type":"page"}]
