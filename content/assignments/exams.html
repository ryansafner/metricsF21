<p>This class will have two (2) exams.</p>
<div id="midterm-exam" class="section level2">
<h2>Midterm Exam</h2>
<p>After we have finished linear regression, there will be a midterm constituting a combination of multiple choice, problem, and short answer questions. This will cover the content we discuss in class, my lectures, and the readings. The midterm provides feedback both to you and to me that ensures everyone is progressing on schedule and comprehending the material. This is critical, as the rest of the course will build off of this foundation.</p>

<div id="final-exam" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Exam</h2>
<p>On the college-determined date, we will have a comprehensive, closed-book, in-class final exam.</p>
