<p>We will do all of our work in this course with the free &amp; open source programming language <code>R</code>. While you can run everything you need directly in the command line using <code>R</code>, it is a lot more convenient to use an integrated development environment (IDE) like <code>R Studio</code>. Think of <code>R</code> as the engine of a car, and <code>R Studio</code> as the dashboard.</p>
<p>You will need to install <em>both</em>, but we will ever only open <code>R Studio.</code></p>
<div id="installing-r" class="section level2">
<h2>Installing <code>R</code></h2>
<p>First you will need to download and install <code>R</code> on your computer.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to the <strong>Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)</strong> that maintains <code>R</code> and its official packages at: <a href="https://cran.r-project.org" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org</a></li>
<li>Click on “Download R for …” your operating system (Mac or Windows)</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If you use a Mac, scroll to the first <code>.pkg</code> file listed on the left and download.</li>
<li>If you use Windows, click on <code>base</code> (“This what you want to <strong>install R for the first time</strong>”)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Install the downloaded package like you would any software application on your computer.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Typically, open the file from your <code>Downloads</code> folder (or whever you save downloaded files) and follow the prompts to install on your computer.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If you use a Mac, also download and install <code>XQuartz</code> (<a href="https://www.xquartz.org/" class="uri">https://www.xquartz.org/</a>). You do not need to do this on Windows.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="install-r-studio" class="section level2">
<h2>Install R Studio</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Go to RStudio.com and download the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">free desktop version</a>.</li>
<li>The website should automatically detect your operating system and give you a large button to click to download the application.</li>
<li>Install the downloaded package like you would any software application on your computer.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="r-studio-cloud" class="section level2">
<h2>R Studio Cloud</h2>
<p>R is free, but sometimes can be difficult to install and configure on your computer. To make things easier, and to ensure everyone has a consistent experience for class, you can (and should) use the free <a href="https://rstudio.cloud">Rstudio.Cloud</a> service <em>initially</em>. This allows you to run <code>R</code> in your browser (i.e. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc), meaning you don’t need to worry about installing things on your computer.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://rstudio.cloud" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud</a> and create an account (please use your first and last name). I will send you a link via email to join our class workspace.</p>
<p>R Studio Cloud is convenient, but is not designed to be as fully customizable and extensive as the main desktop version. I would start with the Cloud version if you have trouble with your own computer or computers on campus running R or R Studio. But ultimately, you will want to eventually do everything on your own computer and not the cloud version.</p>
