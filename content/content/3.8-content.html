<h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>This week we will cover non-linear models, which we anticipated last week with an interaction effect between two continuous variables: <span class="math inline">\(X_1 \times X_2\)</span>, where the marginal effect of <span class="math inline">\(X_1 \rightarrow Y\)</span> is dependent on the value of <span class="math inline">\(X_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>We cover two types of nonlinear models. <em>Today</em>, we cover <strong>polynomial models</strong>, where we include higher-order <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> variables to explain a non-linear effect. <em>Next</em> class we will cover <strong>logarithmic models</strong>, which are more frequently used — as well as a few final tests and transformations for multivariate regression before we turn to panel data (Unit IV) next week.</p>
<p>Today, we will spend the first half of class finishing <a href="/r/3.7-r-practice">last class’ practice problems</a> (on dummy variables and interaction effects), then I will cover polynomial models. After we finish next class’ lecture, we will do another set of R practice problems, and you will be given your final graded <strong>HW 5</strong> to work on this material.</p>

<p>Below, you can find the slides in two formats. Clicking the image will bring you to the html version of the slides in a new tab. Note while in going through the slides, you can type <kbd>h</kbd> to see a special list of viewing options, and type <kbd>o</kbd> for an outline view of all the slides.</p>
<p>The lower button will allow you to download a PDF version of the slides. I suggest printing the slides beforehand and using them to take additional notes in class (<em>not everything</em> is in the slides)!</p>
