<h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview</h2>
<p>We begin with some more time for you to work on the <a href="/r/2.5-r">R Practice</a> from last class.</p>
<p>This week is about inferential statistics: using <em>statistics</em> calculated from a <em>sample</em> of data to <strong>infer</strong> the true (and unmeasurable) <em>parameters</em> that describe a <em>population.</em> In doing so, we can run <em>hypothesis tests</em> on our sample to determine a <em>point</em> estimate of a parameter, or construct a <em>confidence interval</em> from our sample to cast a range for the true parameter.</p>
<p>This is standard principles of statistics - you hopefully should have learned it before. If it has been a while (or never) since your last statistics class, this is one of the hardest concepts to understand at first glance. I recommend <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability">Khan Academy</a> [From sampling distributions through significance tests, for this. Though the whole class is helpful!] or Google for these concepts, as <em>every</em> statistics class will cover them in the standard way.</p>
<p>That being said, I <em>do not</em> cover inferential statistics in the standard way (see the <a href="#Appendix">appendix</a> today below for an overview of the standard way). I think it will be more intuitive if I <em>show</em> you where these concepts come from by <em>simulating</em> a sampling distribution, as opposed to reciting the theoretical sampling distributions.</p>

<p>Bailey teaches inferential statistics in the classical way (with reference to theoretical <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distributions, and <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> tests). This is all valid.

Though the whole class is helpful!].</p>
<p>The latter “book” (also free online, like R4DS) uses the <code>infer</code> package to run simulations for inferential statistics. Chapter 10 is focused on regression (but I also recommend the chapters leading up to it, which are on inferential statistics broadly, using this method).</p>
<p>The final link is a great website for visualizing basic statistic concepts like probability, distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, central limit theorem, and regression.</p>

<h3>Differences Between What We Learned in Class and Classical Statistics</h3>
<p>In class, you learned the basics behind inferential statistics–p-values, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing–via <em>empirical simulation</em> of many samples permuted from our existing data. We took our sample, ran 1,000 simulations by permutation of our sample without replacement<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>, calculated the statistic (<span class="math inline">\(\hat{\beta}_0\)</span>, the slope) of each simulation; this gave us a (sampling) distribution of our sample statistics, and then found the probability on that distribution that we would observe our <em>actual</em> statistic in our actual data – this is the <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-value.</p>
<p>Classically, before the use of computers that could run and visualize 1,000s of simulations within seconds,<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> inferential statistics was taught using <em>theoretical</em> distributions. <strong>Essentially, we calculate a test-statistic by normalizing our finding against a theoretical (null) sampling distribution of our sample statistic, and find p-values by estimating the probability of observing that statistic on that theoretical distribution.</strong> These distributions are almost always <em>normal</em> or <em>normal-like</em> distributions. The distribution that we almost always use in econometrics is the (Student’s) <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution.</p>
<p>Furthermore, testing the null hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(H_0: \,\beta_1=0\)</span>, is not the only type of hypothesis test, nor is the slope the only statistic we can test. In fact, there are many different types of hypothesis tests that are well-known and well-used, we focused entirely on regression (since that is the largest tool of the course).</p>
<p>This appendix will give you more background on the theory of inferential statistics, and is more in line with what you may have learned in earlier statistics courses.</p>

<h3>Inferential Statistics Basics</h3>
<p>It is important to remember several statistical distributions, tools, and facts. Most of them have to do with the <strong>normal distribution</strong>. If <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is normally distributed with mean <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[X \sim N(\mu, \sigma)\]</span></p>

<p>Then recall the <strong>68-95-99.7 empirical rule</strong>, that:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(\mu-1 \sigma \leq X \leq \mu+ 1\sigma) \approx 0.68\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(\mu-2 \sigma \leq X \leq \mu+ 2\sigma) \approx 0.95\)</span></li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(P(\mu-3 \sigma \leq X \leq \mu+ 3\sigma) \approx 0.997\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Again, in English: “68% of the observations fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean; 95% fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean, and 99.7% fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean.”</p>
<p>If we have the <strong>standard normal distribution</strong> with mean 0 and standard deviation 1:</p>
<p><img src="/content/2.6-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>Again, we can <em>standardize</em> any normally-distributed random variable by finding the <strong>Z-score</strong> of each observation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z=\frac{X_i - \mu}{\sigma}\]</span></p>
<p>This ensures the mean will be 0 and standard deviation will be 1. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the number of standard deviations above <span class="math inline">\((+)\)</span> or below <span class="math inline">\((-)\)</span> the mean an observation is.</p>
<p>We can use <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-scores to find the probability of any range of observations of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> occuring in the distribution.</p>

<div id="the-central-limit-theorem" class="section level3">
<h3>The Central Limit Theorem</h3>
<p>Inferential statistics can be summarized in 2 sentences:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are unknown <strong>parameters</strong> that describe a <strong>population</strong> distribution that we want to know. We use <strong>statistics</strong> that describe a <strong>sample</strong> to <em>estimate</em> the population parameters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Recall there is an element of randomness in our sample statistics due to <strong>sampling variability</strong>. For example, if we take the mean of one sample, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>, and then take the mean of a <em>different</em> sample, the <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>’s will be <em>slightly different</em>. We can conceive of a distribution of <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>’s across many different samples, and this is called the <strong>sampling distribution</strong> of the statistic <span class="math inline">\((\bar{x})\)</span>.</p>
<p>Via the sampling distribution, the sample statistic <span class="math inline">\((\bar{X})\)</span> itself is distributed with</p>
<ul>
<li>mean <span class="math inline">\(E[\bar{x}]=\mu_X\)</span> (the true population mean)</li>
<li>standard deviation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\bar{x}}\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Central Limit Theorem</strong>: <em>with large enough sample size (<span class="math inline">\(n\geq30\)</span>), the sampling distribution of a sample statistic is approximately normal</em><a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>Thus, the <strong>sampling distribution of the sample mean</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span>):</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\bar{X} \sim \left(\mu_X, \frac{\sigma_X}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>The second term we call the <strong>standard error of the sample mean</strong><a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a>. Note that it takes the true standard deviation of the population (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span>)<a href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> and divides it by the square root of the sample size, <span class="math inline">\(\sqrt{n}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus <strong>if we know the true population standard deviation</strong> (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span>) then we can simply use the normal distribution for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests of a sample statistic. Since we often do not, we need to use another distribution for inferential statistics, often the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution.</p>
</div>
<div id="if-we-dont-know-sigma-the-students-t-distribution" class="section level3">
<h3>If We Don’t Know <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>: The Student’s <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-Distribution</h3>
<p>We rarely, if ever, know the true population standard deviation for variable <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_X\)</span>. Additionally, we sometimes have sample sizes of <span class="math inline">\(n &lt; 30\)</span>. If either of these conditions are true, we cannot use leverage the Central Limit Theorem and simplify with a standard normal distribution. Instead of the normal distribution, we use a <strong>Student’s t-Distribution</strong><a href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is functionally equivalent to the idea of a <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-score, with some slight modifications:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t = \cfrac{\bar{x}-\mu}{\left(\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right)}\]</span>
- <span class="math inline">\(\bar{x}\)</span> is our estimated statistic (e.g. sample mean)
- <span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span> is the true population parametner (e.g. population mean)
- <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is the sample standard deviation
- <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the sample size</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-scores similarly measure the number of standard deviations an observation is above or below the mean.</p>
<p>The other main difference between normal distributions/<span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-scores and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distributions /<span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-scores is that <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> distributions have <span class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> degrees of freedom.<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[t \sim t_{n-1}\]</span></p>
<pre><code>## Loading required package: viridisLite</code></pre>
<p><img src="/content/2.6-content_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>The standard <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution looks normal-ish, with a mean of 0, but with more area in the tails of the distribution. The exact shape depends on the degrees of freedom <span class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span>. As <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow n\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\uparrow df\)</span>, the <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distribution approximates a normal distribution.</p>
<p>By convention, in regression we <em>always</em> use <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>-distributions for confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. For nearly all of the confidence intervals and hypothesis tests below, we functionally replace <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<div id="confidence-intervals" class="section level3">
<h3>Confidence Intervals</h3>
<p>A <strong>confidence interval</strong> describes the range of estimates for a population parameter in the form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(\text{estimate} - \text{margin of error}, \, \text{estimate} + \text{margin of error})\]</span></p>
<p>Our <em>confidence level</em> is <span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> again is the “significance level”, the probability that the true population parameter is <em>not</em> within our confidence interval<a href="#fn8" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li>Typical confidence levels: 90%, 95%, 99%</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>A confidence interval tells us that if we were to conduct many samples, (<span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span>)% would contain the true population parameter within the interval</p>

<p>To construct a confidence interval, we do the following:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Calculate the sample statistic.</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Find <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-score that corresponds to desired confidence level.</strong><a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> We need to find what are called the <strong>“critical values”</strong> of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, which we will call <span class="math inline">\(Z_{0.5\alpha}\)</span> on the normal distribution that puts (<span class="math inline">\(1-\alpha\)</span>) probability between <span class="math inline">\(\pm Z_{0.5\alpha}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(0.5\alpha\)</span> in each of the tails of the distribution.

<ul>
<li>The confidence interval between the two <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>-scores <span class="math inline">\(-Z_{0.5\alpha}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z_{0.5\alpha}\)</span> contains the desired <span class="math inline">\((1-\alpha)%\)</span> of observations</li>

</ul>
<p>Note that the image above is abstract. So for example, if we wanted a (typical) <strong>95% confidence interval</strong> with <span class="math inline">\(\alpha=0.05\)</span>, the critical value(s) of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> are <span class="math inline">\(\pm 1.96\)</span><a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>, and looking on the distribution:</p>
