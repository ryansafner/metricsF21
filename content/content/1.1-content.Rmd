## <i class="fas fa-info-circle fa-lg"></i> Overview

<span class="newthought">Welcome</span> to ECON 480 — Econometrics! Today's lesson will be an overview of the content and the assignments of the course. Please read and familiarize yourself with the [syllabus](/syllabus). 

This is not just a “syllabus day,” as we need to hit the ground running, beginning with learning the software we will be using this semester. Starting next class, we will do a deep dive in to R for about 2 weeks. In preparation, please do the following **before next class**:

1. Go to [RStudio.cloud](https://rstudio.cloud) and register a (free) account with your Hood details.

2. Try to [install R and R Studio](https://metricsf20.classes.ryansafner.com/reference/#installing-r-and-r-studio) on your computer if you are able, before next class. You will still always have RStudio.cloud available all to use in your browser, but it is much better to have a real version of `R` and `R Studio` on your own machine to work with all semester.

Today is introductory, but please heed this timeless message:

Please note going forward, the lesson numbers and topics (e.g. 1.1) on this website are *my* design, and will not match up with the textbook!

We should probably `test some code`:
